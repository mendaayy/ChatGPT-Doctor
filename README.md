# ChatGPT as a Therapist

## Introduction 

With the app, you can talk to the ChatGPT-powered chatbot named Mia. I created the app with the intention to help people struggling with mental health
or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, but people who just want someone to talk to online can also use the app. 
Mia is an AI therapist who can provide personalized emotional support, as well as recommendations for lifestyle changes 
and self-treatments that are tailored to users' specific needs. She can also just hold a normal conversation to get to know each other as friends.
In addition, Mia can also speak and analyzes users' skills, interests, and personality in order to tailor her personality to match that of the user. This
approach is aimed at creating a more meaningful interaction with the chatbot, thereby increasing its effectiveness in providing guidance and support. 

## Background

**Problem Statement**

Individuals with mental health or those with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), often experience a diminished quality of 
life due to a lack of emotional support and knowledge about their condition. Existing resources and support systems may not adequately 
address their specific needs. 

**Solution**

The proposed solution is an AI-powered chatbot application designed to cater to the needs of individuals in need of emotional support 
or just someone to talk to whenever they want. With AI technology, it will enable the chatbot to provide personalized guidance, emotional support, and 
recommendations for lifestyle changes and self-treatments tailored to the individual's specific needs. 

**Process**

This project took 1 month from doing UX research to development of the app. Throughout the whole process, I followed the Design 
Thinking approach: the [Design Kit](https://www.designkit.org/). For each phase of the project, I used relevant research methods 
to gather and define the target audience and their needs. In the end, I followed an iterative design process to refine the prototype 
as much as possible and needed until the deadline.

## Front-end Development 

**My contribution**

I coded the whole app from integrating the [ChatGPT API](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis) to coding the UI. 
I made use of the Chat GPT3.5-turbo model to assign the AI a system role of a personal health coach buddy who has knowledge about CFS and tries to always become 
with the user. In addition, I also added a speaker option by using the AVFoundation in Swift.

**Tools & Technology**
- ChatGPT3.5-turbo model API
- Swift in Xcode
- AVFoundation for speaker
